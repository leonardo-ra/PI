# roboPtics - Robotic arms in an Optics Production Line

> A project within the purview of University of Aveiro's course subject: Projeto Industrial.  The subject gives a group of students the opportunity to work with well-established companies, within the Electrical Engineering field. As pitched by PICadvanced S.A. at the time, the objective consisted of integrating camera (computer vision) in a robotic arm (UR5e), to further increase the automation and output of their production line.
This git repository details the developments made by the team of six students who tackled this project.
